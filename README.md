## Running

### Via Pipelines

If the repository has been forked, the Github actions can be used to trigger the pipelines.
Before running, below values would need to be added within secrets section of the GitHub repository

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your AWS PEM ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your AWS secrets credentials
AWS_REGION=region you want to trigger cloudformation stack in
DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password you wish to set for the db
```

After these have been set, can create a pull request within the repository which will trigger the pipeline for deploying to dev environment.

### Via AWS UI

Use the below section (Creating lambda on S3 with external pymysql package installed (manually)) to first manually package the code and make this available on s3.

Then login to AWS, go to Cloudformation service.

Create new stack, use template, select `l00196611-lambda-api.yaml` file in this repository.

Ensure you pass the correct s3 bucket and file path resource within s3.

## Creating lambda on S3 with external pymysql package installed (manually)

Create lambda code with external pymysql package installed

```
mkdir package
pip install pymysql -t package/
cp index.py package/
cd package
zip -r ../birthday_present_tracker_lambda.zip .
```

Upload to s3 manually (manual creation of bucket and then upload of zipped directory from above)

```
cd ..
aws s3 mb s3://birthday-present-tracker-lambda-deployment-bucket
aws s3 cp birthday_present_tracker_lambda.zip s3://birthday-present-tracker-lambda-deployment-bucket/birthday_present_lambda.zip
```

## Documentation

[cfn-diagram](https://github.com/ljacobsson/cfn-diagram) used to generate architecture diagrams

Can be installed with the below (note Node must already be installed on the machine - for more info on installing Node.js see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download))

```
npm i -g @mhlabs/cfn-diagram
```

Generate draw.io diagram (edge labels, resources to display etc can be toggled from menu in terminal)

```
cfn-dia draw.io --template-file l00196611-lambda-api.yaml --output-file diagram.drawio
```

Images were generated by loading the generated document in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and then exporting as PNG

HTML format can be generated using the below command

```
cfn-dia html --template-file l00196611-lambda-api.yaml -o diagram-test.html
```
